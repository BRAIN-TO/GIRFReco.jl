# Contributing to GIRFReco.jl
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork or clone the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Add docstrings to facilitate our generated documentation.
4. Ensure your (and our) tests pass
5. Post the PR or file an issue and we will work with you

## Any contributions you make will be under the BSD 3-Clause Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [BSD 3-Clause License
](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/bsd-3-clause/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/BRAIN-TO/GIRFReco.jl/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/BRAIN-TO/GIRFReco.jl/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can, a minimum working example (MWE) is best but we understand MRI involves complicated and large data
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* We (mostly) use Julia [Blue](https://github.com/invenia/BlueStyle)
* It would be great if you did as well
