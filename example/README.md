# Quick Guide for Running GIRFReco Example

You can find code details of the example script [here](https://brain-to.github.io/GIRFReco.jl).

## System Configuration

Though compatibility with older versions of Julia may exist, our testing environment is Julia with version 1.9.3, and we recommend to use the same or newer version of Julia.

We also recommend to leave at least 30 GB disk space for the example data and all dependent Julia packages.

The reconstructed Cartesian and Spiral images in NIfTI format will be in the folder `joss_data_zenodo/results`. We recommend to use [FSLeyes](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSLeyes) as the viewer to open them.

## Steps of Running the GIRFReco Example

### (1) Cloning the package

Download or clone the repo to your local by:

```
git clone git@github.com:BRAIN-TO/GIRFReco.jl.git
```

Then enter the `example` folder:

```
cd GIRFReco.jl/example
```

Alternatively, for the one who are using Visual Studio Code, simply open the `example` sub-folder from the Menu option `File -> Open Folder...`.


### (2) Run in Julia REPL

We recommend to use Visual Studio Code with Julia extension (steps of installation can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/julia)) to avoid possible image displaying issue, especially for those using SSH and X11 forwarding.

The Julia REPL can be launched from the Command Palette (For Windows and Linux: Press `Shift + Ctrl + P`; For Mac: Press `Shift + Command + P`) by searching the command `Julia: Start REPL`.

In the launched REPL, simply execute the following command after launching the REPL to run the whole demonstration script (including the data download):

```julia
include("run_example.jl")
```

If you only want to download the demonstration dataset, run:

```julia
include("download_data.jl")
```

### (3) After running your first example ...

"Watch a movie, or be part of one". You are also encouraged to be part of our repo by playing around with the [configuration file]([`recon_config_joss_demo.jl`](./recon_config_joss_demo.jl)) and see how (and why) the results are changed. For example:

(1) How do the results change when we turn off the Bâ‚€ correction (by setting `do_correct_with_b0_map` as `false`)?

(2) What will the images look like when we turn off the zeroth and/or the first order GIRF correction (set `do_correct_with_girf_k0` and/or `do_correct_with_girf_k1` as `false`)?

(3) Try reconstruction with multiple spiral interleaves by enabling line 97. What changes do you see?

And so many more options to explore...
