	abstract = {We investigated the use of physically-motivated corrections for non-Cartesian imaging within a fast, open-source MR reconstruction framework written in the Julia programming language. Building on existing Julia libraries for MR image reconstruction, we developed a comprehensive, open-source pipeline for non-Cartesian image reconstruction including B0 inhomogeneity correction, gradient system characterization and eddy current correction. We demonstrated that spiral images can be reconstructed using this pipeline with high geometric accuracy in a fast, accessible and efficient manner on modest hardware.},

	ISSN={2333-9403}, 
	DOI={10.1109/TCI.2020.3031082}, 
	abstractNote={Magnetic field inhomogeneity estimation is important in some types of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including field-corrected reconstruction for fast MRI with long readout times, and chemical shift based water-fat imaging. Regularized field map estimation methods that account for phase wrapping and noise involve nonconvex cost functions that require iterative algorithms. Most existing minimization techniques were computationally or memory intensive for 3D datasets, and are designed for single-coil MRI. This article considers 3D MRI with optional consideration of coil sensitivity, and addresses the multi-echo field map estimation and water-fat imaging problem. Our efficient algorithm uses a preconditioned nonlinear conjugate gradient method based on an incomplete Cholesky factorization of the Hessian of the cost function, along with a monotonic line search. Numerical experiments show the computational advantage of the proposed algorithm over state-of-the-art methods with similar memory requirements.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this work is to explore the feasibility and performance of single-shot spiral MRI at 7 T, using an expanded signal model for reconstruction. Methods Gradient-echo brain imaging is performed on a 7 T system using high-resolution single-shot spiral readouts and half-shot spirals that perform dual-image acquisition after a single excitation. Image reconstruction is based on an expanded signal model including the encoding effects of coil sensitivity, static off-resonance, and magnetic field dynamics. The latter are recorded concurrently with image acquisition, using NMR field probes. The resulting image resolution is assessed by point spread function analysis. Results Single-shot spiral imaging is achieved at a nominal resolution of 0.8 mm, using spiral-out readouts of 53-ms duration. High depiction fidelity is achieved without conspicuous blurring or distortion. Effective resolutions are assessed as 0.8, 0.94, and 0.98 mm in CSF, gray matter and white matter, respectively. High image quality is also achieved with half-shot acquisition yielding image pairs at 1.5-mm resolution. Conclusion Use of an expanded signal model enables single-shot spiral imaging at 7 T with unprecedented image quality. Single-shot and half-shot spiral readouts deploy the sensitivity benefit of high field for rapid high-resolution imaging, particularly for functional MRI and arterial spin labeling.},

  abstract = {Spiral diffusion imaging has been shown to provide substantial SNR advantages ({$>$}50\%) over state-of-the-art echo-planar imaging, due to the attainable shorter echo times. We investigate the feasibility of this approach on a standard 3T MR system without additional instrumentation. All tools for successful implementation are freely made available, i.e., the characterization measurement for the gradient system using a standard phantom, and an open-source, fast image reconstruction suite in Julia correcting for gradient imperfections, eddy currents, and static B0 off-resonance. We show that this low-cost, accessible solution provides high-resolution diffusion images (1.1mm) in-vivo with reduced geometric distortion and improved quantitative maps.},
