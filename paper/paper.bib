	abstract = {We investigated the use of physically-motivated corrections for non-Cartesian imaging within a fast, open-source MR reconstruction framework written in the Julia programming language. Building on existing Julia libraries for MR image reconstruction, we developed a comprehensive, open-source pipeline for non-Cartesian image reconstruction including B0 inhomogeneity correction, gradient system characterization and eddy current correction. We demonstrated that spiral images can be reconstructed using this pipeline with high geometric accuracy in a fast, accessible and efficient manner on modest hardware.},

	ISSN={2333-9403}, 
	DOI={10.1109/TCI.2020.3031082}, 
	abstractNote={Magnetic field inhomogeneity estimation is important in some types of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including field-corrected reconstruction for fast MRI with long readout times, and chemical shift based water-fat imaging. Regularized field map estimation methods that account for phase wrapping and noise involve nonconvex cost functions that require iterative algorithms. Most existing minimization techniques were computationally or memory intensive for 3D datasets, and are designed for single-coil MRI. This article considers 3D MRI with optional consideration of coil sensitivity, and addresses the multi-echo field map estimation and water-fat imaging problem. Our efficient algorithm uses a preconditioned nonlinear conjugate gradient method based on an incomplete Cholesky factorization of the Hessian of the cost function, along with a monotonic line search. Numerical experiments show the computational advantage of the proposed algorithm over state-of-the-art methods with similar memory requirements.},
